## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

- The main goal was to tackle the aspects that I found interesting or challenging such as the styling of the cards on the features and porfolio section. Fairly proud of that, as well as the blending of icons into the background.

# Continued Development

WORK THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE 

- Complete the markup and styling of all sections of the site, currently remaining, the main Hero section, the form section and the Google Maps part.
- Learn and implement the accordion section.
- Media Queries to make it mobile and tablet friendly.
